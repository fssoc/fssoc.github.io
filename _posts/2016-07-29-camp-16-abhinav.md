I thought FSMK camp '16 would be a good way to kill some time but soon realized that it was much more than that. I learnt lot of new things like FOSS, web-backend and much more.

FSMK camp is a volunteer-driven camp organised by FSMK. It's a non-profit organisation dedicated to promote usage of free and open source softwares. 

The camp was seven days long held at Siddaganga Institute of Technology, Tumkur. It's a well maintained big campus filled with greenery. Ideal location for a seven-day camp. This time there were four tracks i.e web-frontend, web-backend, hardware and animation. I chose web-backend.

First day was all about understanding the importance of FOSS and its applications to solve a problem. The best way to understand this was to install an open source linux based OS. So we installed a customised distro of fedora.

In the next few days the morning session was about copyrights, Creative Commons, privacy policies and software patents and we got our hands dirty using FOSS in later sessions. In web-backend we worked on python, flask â€“ a python framework and mongodb. We also built a web application using flask and mongodb.

Apart from learning new things we had some fun activities and after the sessions we pranked a bunch of participants and volunteers which was really cool.

The camp concluded with a closing ceremony where we shared our experiences in this camp and received our certificates.

All in all it was a great way of killing some time, meeting new and interesting people and learn from them.
