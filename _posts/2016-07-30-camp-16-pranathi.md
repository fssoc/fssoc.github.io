I was introduced to free and open source software (FOSS) world through FSMK Camp â€˜16  held in lush green, serene campus of Siddaganga Institute of Technology, Tumkur. It was a seven day long camp which devotes itself in spreading knowledge for free. Their ideal principle being software should be free and open to view, edit and upload the source code.

The camp comprised of three different tracks - design and animation, Web and hardware. As I chose design and animation track, I grabbed the opportunity to learn Inkscape, Blender and Gimp. Each day kicked off with some fun- filled activities which made us accomplish the knowledge of patents, copyrights and creative commons presented by members at SFLC. The speakers at the camp were outspoken and volunteers gave us a helping hand at each step. The sessions were flawless, enthusiastic and interactive which boosted the very spirit of learning. Lastly, I felt exhilarated, startled at the closing ceremony which included singing along with dance. Everyone grooved to the beats and made the camp truly memorable.

This camp has been a platform to meet several people of various walks of life and has challenged my preconceptions of procuring only technical knowledge by developing as a individual and leaving your mark in the society. I miss everything about this camp starting from walking in SIT campus, smelling the petrichor of morning rain, intellectual discussions at the mess, designing a new object everyday. Waiting for succeeding FSMK camps, hungry for more!
