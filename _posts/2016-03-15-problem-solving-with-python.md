Now that we’re done with our <a href="https://fssoc.github.io/2016/03/14/intro-to-processing/" target="_blank">sessions</a> on <strong>Graphics Programming using Processing</strong>, we’re moving on to <strong>Problem Solving Techniques</strong>. What are Problem Solving Techniques? Well, they're a set of methods you use to solve a given problem.

We're going to be teaching you to approach a problem in an organised manner. We'll also be teaching you how to break down a problem into a set of sub-problems, which will allow you to solve it more easily.

We're going to be using Python for these sessions. Python is a highly portable scripting language and is *very* easy to pick up. We'll be giving you an introduction to Python so don't worry, we don't expect you to know *anything* about it. If you want to use any other language, you're free to do so! In fact, we'll assist you to the best of our abilities.

By the end of these sessions, we want you guys to be able to solve any moderately difficult problem we throw at you. After all, that's what a good programmer should be able to do!
