The civic problems we face in today's world are tremendous and instead of the number of complaints reducing in time, they’re increasing at an alarming rate. So, Shashank M Chakravarthy (senior member of FSMK), thought of helping the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike), by building a complaint portal. This portal not only accepts complaints of the citizens, it also keeps a check on whether or not the complaint has been tended to.

So here’s how the portal would work. Bangalore would be divided region-wise. If a citizen has a problem? Simple. They just log onto the portal, sign up and put in the complaint in their respective region. The complaint registered would be directed to a BBMP official who would take over the task from there . The portal would include an “upvote” system, where the citizens can view the complaint and if they feel that the complaint requires more attention and needs to be tended to immediately, they upvote the complaint. So, the number of upvotes gives the government clarity about the priority with which they need to resolve problems. So, more number of upvotes implies that the problem is critical and needs to be resolved immediately. When the BBMP has tended to the problem, they update the portal that the problem has been resolved. The citizen who had complained then verifies this and has a say on whether or not the problem was resolved.

Our major tasks not only involve building the portal, but also marketing it through various platforms, with social media being the most crucial. So, Rahul came up with the idea of using posting photos of the problems we as citizens face on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc with the hashtag - ‘#fixmaadi’, creating a trend which would carry on. 
	
We formed the technical team, headed by Abhinav Bhopardikar. They will soon start working on the frontend using JavaScript, with an aim of creating a user friendly and interactive website for all the citizens of Bangalore.
