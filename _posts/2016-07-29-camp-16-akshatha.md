My friends and I who had no experience of being a part of any Technology related camp, got registered. Trust me, it has more to do with than just technology!  

I got an opportunity to meet the most dedicated and interesting people at this camp. They got out of their way and made us understand the topics well. Be it  - FOSS philosophy or Life philosophy or Heisenberg’s uncertainty principles!

This year, the Seven days FSMK-camp was organized in Siddaganga Institute of Technology at Tumkur, a lush green campus which is a rare sight in many colleges here in Bangalore. There were three tracks – Web (front end / back end), Design & Animation and Hardware. I chose Design & Animation.

First day, the camp started with an introduction to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Ubuntu installation process, which is a tradition of FSMK camp.

Our days started off with an hour long activity based talks on ‘Copy rights’, ‘Patents’, ‘Online Privacy’ by SFLC members followed by us rushing to the labs and learning about the tracks which we chose. During the food times, the mess used to be filled with people, food and all those intellectual conversations. 

At the end there was a cultural ceremony held. Everyone danced, sang and cheered. The atmosphere was energetic! Never knew it would be so much fun.  

The camp was concluded by taking our feedbacks and they bid goodbye by giving away appreciation certificates to all the participants and volunteers. I’m very glad that I was a part of FSMK Camp’16 and could bond with all those people. Hope I’ll be a part of future camps to be conducted as a volunteer.
