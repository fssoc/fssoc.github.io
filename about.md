<p class="lead">Free Software Society</p>

We’re a bunch of likeminded folk who like to learn to use and develop Free Software (FS).

<strong>So, what’s Free Software?</strong>

Free Software comes with a bunch of freedoms. This includes the freedom to use the software however the user wants to, the freedom to modify the software, and the freedom to (re)distribute the software. As we’re fond of saying, it’s “free as in freedom.”

There are many organisations dedicated to the promotion of FS, the biggest being the Free Software Foundation, headed by Richard Stallman. In India, we have the Free Software Movement India (FSMI), which acts as an umbrella to various state level organisations such as Free Software Movement Karnataka (FSMK), Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu (FSFTN), and Swecha (formerly Free Software Foundation Andhra Pradesh).

So, what do we do? We perform the same functions at a college level. We work with FSMK to promote the use and development of FS in our college, SJB Institute of Technology (SJBIT).

Come and join us!
